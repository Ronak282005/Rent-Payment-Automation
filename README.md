## Project Vision
The Rent Payment Automation smart contract aims to revolutionize the traditional leasing industry by eliminating intermediaries, reducing paperwork, and increasing transparency. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can create trustless leasing agreements where all terms are enforced programmatically, payments are processed automatically, and the history of all transactions is immutably recorded.

The vision is to create a global, decentralized marketplace where anyone can lease their assets securely without geographical limitations, currency conversion issues, or concerns about contract enforcement. This system will make leasing more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective for both lessors and lessees.
